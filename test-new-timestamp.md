# 🧪 Test New Timestamp Implementation

## Smart Timestamp Adjustment

The extension now **subtracts 2 seconds** from the video timestamp to ensure you hear the sentence from the beginning, not from the middle where you clicked.

## Expected Behavior

When you Alt+Click on YouTube subtitles, you should now see these logs:

```
📨 Processing YouTube learning text: [text]
🔍 Starting timestamp detection...
🎬 Video element found: true
✅ Video timestamp from video element: 617 seconds
🎯 Adjusted timestamp (minus 2s for sentence start): 615 seconds
⏰ Captured video timestamp: 615
🔗 Created timestamped URL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=ID&t=615s (timestamp: 615s)
✅ Timestamp URL validation passed: t=615s (adjusted for sentence start)
🚀 Sending to background script: {url: "...&t=615s", timestamp: 615}
```

## Test Steps

1. **Reload YouTube page** (to get updated content script)
2. **Play video for 10+ minutes** (like at 10:15 = 615 seconds)
3. **Enable learning mode** (red button → green)
4. **Alt+Click subtitle** (for AI analysis)
5. **Check console logs** (Command+Option+I on Mac)

## Expected Results

- ✅ Console shows `✅ Video timestamp from video element: XXX seconds`
- ✅ Console shows `✅ Timestamp URL validation passed: t=XXXs`
- ✅ History shows "⏰ 返回片段" instead of "📹 返回影片"
- ✅ Clicking "返回片段" takes you to exact moment in video

## URL Format Examples (with 2-second adjustment)

| Click Time | Raw Calculation | Adjusted (minus 2s) | URL Format |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------| 
| 0:45 | 45 | 43 | `&t=43s` |
| 2:15 | 2×60+15 = 135 | 133 | `&t=133s` |
| 10:17 | 10×60+17 = 617 | 615 | `&t=615s` |
| 1:05:32 | 1×3600+5×60+32 = 3932 | 3930 | `&t=3930s` |

**Why subtract 2 seconds?** When you click on a subtitle, you probably want to hear the sentence from the beginning, not from the middle where you clicked.

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Check if these logs appear:
- ❌ `No video element found` → Video detection issue
- ❌ `Video currentTime is invalid` → Timing issue  
- ❌ `Timestamp URL validation failed` → URL creation issue

The implementation is now correct for YouTube's format!
