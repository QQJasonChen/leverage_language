# YouTube Language Learning Extension - Technical Implementation

## 🚀 Overview

This Chrome extension enhances YouTube's subtitle system with precision word selection and AI-powered language learning features.

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### Core Functionality
- **Precision Word Selection**: Individual word hover and click detection on YouTube subtitles
- **Smart Text Processing**: Handles word boundaries, punctuation, and sentence detection
- **AI Analysis Integration**: Connects selected text to AI language analysis services
- **Sidepanel Communication**: Seamless data flow between content scripts and extension sidepanel

### Key Components

#### 1. YouTube Content Script (`youtube-standalone-inject.js`)
- Enhances YouTube subtitles with word-level interactivity
- Implements hover effects and click handlers
- Manages visual feedback and animations
- Handles CSP-compliant event delegation

#### 2. Background Service Worker (`background.js`)
- Routes messages between content scripts and sidepanel
- Manages extension state and tab information
- Handles cross-component communication

#### 3. Sidepanel Interface (`sidepanel.js`)
- Displays AI analysis results
- Manages user preferences (auto-analysis toggle)
- Provides quick actions (speak, save, re-analyze)
- Handles multiple AI service integration attempts
