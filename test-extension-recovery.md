# 🛠️ Extension Context Recovery Test

## The Issue
When the extension is updated/reloaded during development, content scripts lose their connection to the background script, causing "Extension context invalidated" errors.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Robust Error Handling**: Catches context invalidation errors
2. **User-Friendly Notifications**: Shows clear message about needing page refresh
3. **Console Noise Reduction**: Filters out irrelevant messages from other extensions
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Extension fails gracefully instead of throwing errors

## Testing Steps

### Normal Operation Test
1. Go to YouTube video
2. Click "📚 LEARN" button (should turn green)
3. Alt+Click on subtitle text
4. Should see successful message processing logs

### Extension Recovery Test
1. Go to YouTube video with learning mode enabled
2. Reload the extension (in Chrome: Extensions > Reload)
3. Try to Alt+Click on subtitle text
4. **Expected Result**: Should see orange notification: "📚 Extension updated! Please refresh the page to continue learning."
5. Refresh the YouTube page
6. Enable learning mode again and test - should work normally

## Expected Console Logs

### Normal Operation:
```
🔔 Content script received YouTube learning message: [text]
📨 Processing YouTube learning text: [text]
🔍 Starting timestamp detection...
✅ Video timestamp from video element: X seconds
🚀 Sending to background script: {action: "analyzeTextInSidepanel"...}
✅ Successfully sent to background script: {success: true}
```

### After Extension Reload (Context Invalidated):
```
🔔 Content script received YouTube learning message: [text]
🚀 Sending to background script: {action: "analyzeTextInSidepanel"...}
❌ Extension context invalid - chrome.runtime not available
```
*Orange notification appears: "📚 Extension updated! Please refresh the page to continue learning."*

### After Page Refresh:
```
🎬 YouTube content script loaded
[Normal operation logs resume]
```

## Key Improvements
- **No more red error console spam**
- **Clear user guidance** when extension needs refresh
- **Reduced console noise** from other extensions
- **Graceful error handling** prevents crashes
- **Professional user experience** during development

## For Users
If you see the orange notification, simply **refresh the YouTube page** and the extension will work normally again.
