## Example Comparisons

### For a Correct Sentence: "I'd like a cup of coffee, please."

**Old Approach:**
> 語法分析：這是一個使用情態動詞would的禮貌請求句...

**New Approach:**
> 太棒了！這是完全正確的英語表達！您已經掌握了禮貌用語的精髓。
> 
> 讓我們探索更多說法：
> - 😊 朋友間："Can I get a coffee?" (更隨意)
> - 👔 正式場合："May I have a cup of coffee, please?" (更正式)
> - 🚀 進階表達："I'll have a coffee, thanks!" (自信果斷)

### For a Sentence with Error: "I very like coffee."

**Old Approach:**
> ❌ 錯誤：副詞位置錯誤。正確：I like coffee very much.

**New Approach:**
> 🌱 學習機會來了！您已經掌握了基本結構，真棒！
> 
> 小調整建議：
> ✏️ "I really like coffee" 或 "I like coffee very much"
> 
> 💡 記憶技巧：英語的 "very" 不能直接放在動詞前面，
> 就像中文不說「我很喜歡」而說「我非常喜歡」一樣！
