# ðŸŽ­ Simple Netflix Fix

## The Problem
The complex Netflix API interception was causing "Extension context invalidated" errors and preventing the sidepanel from working.

## The Solution
I've simplified the Netflix implementation to use only **manual capture** which is more reliable.

## How to Use Netflix Subtitle Capture Now:

### 1. **Refresh Netflix Page**
- Close and reopen the Netflix tab
- This clears any extension context errors

### 2. **Open Extension Sidepanel**
- Click the YouGlish extension icon in Chrome toolbar
- The sidepanel should open normally now

### 3. **Use Manual Capture**
- Go to the "Transcript" section in the sidepanel
- You'll see a **red "Capture" button** (Netflix-specific)
- When subtitles appear on screen, click "Capture"
- The subtitle text will be saved and analyzed

### 4. **Verify It's Working**
- Enable Netflix subtitles (CC button)
- Wait for subtitle text to appear
- Click the red "Capture" button
- You should see: "âœ… Captured: [subtitle text]"
- The text will appear in the sidepanel for analysis

## What I Fixed:
- âœ… Disabled problematic API interception
- âœ… Fixed timestamp formatting errors
- âœ… Added error handling for context invalidation
- âœ… Simplified to focus on working capture button

## If Sidepanel Still Won't Open:
1. **Disable and re-enable the extension**
2. **Refresh all Netflix tabs**
3. **Try opening sidepanel on a different website first**
4. **Then go back to Netflix**

The capture button should now work reliably without context errors!
