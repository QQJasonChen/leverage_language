# 🔍 Timestamp Debug Test Instructions

## The Issue
- You see "返回影片" but NOT "返回片段" 
- This means `videoTimestamp` is null in saved records
- Research confirms timestamp capture IS technically possible

## Test Steps

### 1. First - Test Basic YouTube Video Access
1. Go to any YouTube video 
2. Play it for 30+ seconds
3. Open Console (F12)
4. Type: `document.querySelector('video').currentTime`
5. **Expected Result**: Should show current playback time (e.g., 34.567)

### 2. If Step 1 Works - Test Our Extension
1. Go to YouTube video
2. Click the red "📚 LEARN" button (should turn green "✅ ON")
3. Click on any subtitle text
4. Watch console for these logs:

**Expected Content Script Logs:**
```
🔍 Starting timestamp detection...
🎬 Video element found: true
✅ Video timestamp from video element: XX seconds
📤 Sending message to background script: {timestamp: XX}
🔍 CRITICAL DEBUG - Message timestamp value: {timestamp: XX, timestampType: "number"}
```

**Expected Background Script Logs:**
```
🔍 CRITICAL DEBUG - Background received timestamp: {timestamp: XX, timestampNull: false}
🎯 Final videoSource object: {videoTimestamp: XX}
```

### 3. Diagnosis Based on Results

**If Step 1 FAILS:**
- YouTube has blocked basic video access
- Feature is not currently feasible

**If Step 1 WORKS but Step 2 shows null timestamps:**
- Our content script isn't finding the video element
- Need to adjust video selectors

**If Step 2 shows valid timestamps but history still has null:**
- Issue is in background script processing
- Check message passing

## Quick Test Questions
1. Does `document.querySelector('video').currentTime` work in YouTube console?
2. Do you see the "🔍 Starting timestamp detection..." log when clicking subtitles?
3. What timestamp value appears in the "CRITICAL DEBUG" logs?

## Expected Outcome
If basic video access works, we can definitely fix this. The issue is likely:
- Video element selector not matching YouTube's current DOM
- Race condition with async/await timing
- Message passing issue between content script and background
